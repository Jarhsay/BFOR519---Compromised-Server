# BFOR519---Compromised-Server
Overview 
The objective of our project was to analyse multiple Linux system logs to identify indicators of compromise on a potentially attacked server. Using LNAV for multi log correlation, we examined authentication behaviour, kernel errors, service activity, and HTTP requests across log files including auth.log, kern.log, daemon.log, and Apache logs.
Through targeted filtering, pattern detection, and cross log comparisons, we identified several red flags such as repeated SSH segmentation faults, abnormal service restarts, and suspicious web requests signals commonly associated with exploitation attempts or system tampering.
Our project demonstrated practical digital forensics and incident response skills by showing how real analysts detect suspicious activity, validate security concerns, and extract meaningful insights from raw system logs using open source tools.
