Final Results: Compromised Server Investigation


A) Overall Verdict
The server is fully compromised. Attackers gained direct root access via SSH passwords, conducted brute-force attacks, exploited or destabilized the SSH service (sshd segfaults), and probed the WordPress/PHP stack.
Evidence shows persistent access across multiple days, lateral movement via su, and system instability consistent with tampering or exploitation.This is not a minor intrusion it is a complete breach of 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

B) Detailed Findings
   1. Initial Access
    •	Attackers successfully logged in via SSH using password authentication.
    •	Accounts compromised: root, dhg, user1, fido.
    •	Multiple external IPs involved (e.g., 190.166.87.164, 151.81.204.141, 122.226.202.12).
    •	Critical: Direct root logins confirm total system control without needing privilege escalation.
   2. Privilege Escalation
    •	Frequent su attempts to root by user1 and user3.
    •	Authentication failures followed by successes suggest password guessing or shared root credentials.
    •	Indicates lateral movement and misuse of local accounts.
   3. Persistence & Activity
    •	Successful logins repeated over multiple days and times.
    •	Attackers maintained access from rotating IPs, showing intentional persistence.
    •	Evidence of WordPress cron jobs and plugin activity suggests attackers may have leveraged the web stack for persistence or secondary exploitation.
   4. Brute-force Attempts
    •	Source IP 65.208.122.48 launched rapid, automated attempts against dozens of usernames (php, diana, cam, astro, etc.).
    •	Classic dictionary attack behavior with attempts every 2 seconds.
    •	Confirms the server was exposed to internet-wide scanning and brute-force campaigns.
   5. System Instability
    •	Kernel logs show dozens of sshd segfaults in bursts, all at the same memory address (RIP 8048e33).
    •	This strongly suggests:
       o	Exploit attempts against sshd.
       o	Binary tampering or corruption.
       o	Environment instability under attack load.
    •	Implication: The sshd binary and system integrity cannot be trusted.
   6. Web Layer Exposure
    •	WordPress activity (wp-cron.php, plugin scripts).
    •	Suspicious external GET requests to wantsfly.com/prx2.php with hash parameters.
    •	Frequent 404s against odd image paths.
    •	Implication: Attackers probed or attempted exploitation of the PHP/WordPress stack, possibly planting webshells. 

C) Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
   •	Compromised Accounts: root, dhg, user1, fido
   •	Malicious IPs:
     o	SSH access: 190.166.87.164, 151.81.204.141, 122.226.202.12, 208.80.69.70
    o	Brute-force: 65.208.122.48
  •	Kernel Faults: sshd segfault at RIP 8048e33, error 4
  •	Web Suspicion: wantsfly.com/prx2.php, WordPress plugin paths

D) Final Result Statement
The server is compromised beyond safe remediation.Attackers achieved root access, maintained persistent sessions, attempted brute-force attacks, and likely probed the web stack. 
The sshd segfaults indicate possible exploitation or tampering.
